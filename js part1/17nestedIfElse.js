/* A nested if/else statement in JavaScript is a conditional structure 
where one if/else statement is placed inside another if/else statement. This
 allows you to create more complex decision-making logic by evaluating multiple conditions.

Here's a brief description along with an example code snippet in JavaScript: */
// Example of a nested if/else statement in JavaScript
let x = 5;
let y = 5;

if (x > y) {
    console.log("x is greater than y");
} else {
    if (x < y) {
        console.log("x is less than y");
    } else {
        console.log("x is equal to y");
    }
}


/* In this example, we first check if x is greater than y. If it is, the first block of 
code is executed. If not, we enter the nested if/else statement, where we check if x is 
less than y. If this condition is true, the second block of code is executed. If neither 
condition is true, the else block within the nested if/else statement is executed. 
This nested structure allows for more precise control over the program's flow based on 
multiple conditions in JavaScript. */
